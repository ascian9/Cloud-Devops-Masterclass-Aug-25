## What is SDLC?

**SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)** is a structured process for building software systems efficiently and with quality. It defines the stages involved in developing a software product from start to finish.

### SDLC Phases:
1. **Requirement Gathering** – Understand user needs
2. **Planning** – Define scope, resources, and timelines
3. **Design** – Create technical architecture
4. **Development** – Write the actual code
5. **Testing** – Validate the product against requirements
6. **Deployment** – Release the product to users
7. **Maintenance** – Fix bugs, make improvements post-deployment

### Common SDLC Models:
- **Waterfall**
- **Agile** (most modern)

## What is Agile?

Agile is an iterative approach to software development where teams deliver value to customers faster and with fewer headaches.

### Key Concepts:
- **Short sprints**
- **Continuous feedback**
- **Cross-functional teams**
- **User stories, epics, and backlogs**

## Agile vs DevOps

| Feature                 | Agile                                 | DevOps                                      |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Focus**               | Software development                  | Software development **and** operations     |
| **Goal**                | Faster delivery of software features  | Faster and more reliable delivery pipelines |
| **Team Structure**      | Developers & QA                       | Dev, QA, Ops (cross-functional teams)        |
| **Feedback Frequency**  | After each sprint                     | Continuous (real-time monitoring)            |
| **Tools**               | Jira, Confluence, Scrum boards        | Git, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.       |
| **Automation Level**    | Medium (mostly testing)               | High (CI/CD, infra as code, monitoring)      |
| **End Result**          | Working software                      | Working software that’s stable in production |

## DevOps Overview

DevOps is a cultural and technical movement that combines software development (Dev) with IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle and deliver high-quality software continuously.

### 5 Key DevOps Principles:
1. **Collaboration** – Dev and Ops work as one team
2. **Automation** – Code builds, testing, deployment
3. **Continuous Improvement** – Short iterations, constant learning
4. **Customer-Centric** – Build based on real user feedback
5. **Create with the End in Mind** – Think about the live environment from Day 1

## Git & GitHub Basics (Hands-on)

### Git:
A distributed version control system used to manage code history and collaboration.

### GitHub:
An online platform to host and share Git repositories.

### Essential Commands:
```bash
git init
git clone <repo-url>
git status
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push origin main
